# 👻 Haunted Roast Bot  
*"Where ghosts come alive... just to roast you."*
It’s designed to be completely impractical, creepy, and financially useless exactly as intended.

---

## 🔥 Overview
Most chatbots want to *help you*.  
This one? It summons **cursed spirits** whose only job is to **insult you**.  

Instead of a friendly AI, you’ll be roasted by legends like:

- **Annabelle** – Creepy doll energy, passive-aggressive burns.  
- **Bloody Mary** – Shows up when you least want her, and never with compliments.  
- **Slenderman** – Silent… until he destroys your self-esteem.  
- **La Llorona** – Wails your failures into the night.  
- **Charlie Charlie** – Summons judgment in the quietest way possible.  
- **Hanako-san** – Bathroom hauntings with sharp critiques.  
- **The Nun** – Pious? Maybe. Merciless? Definitely.  
- **Pennywise** – Clowning around… at your expense.  
- **Random Phantom Guests** – The backup ghost when other's aren't enough.

Every conversation feels like a séance gone wrong 😭😭

If you’re easily offended…
don’t talk to the ghosts.

Remember… the roast isn’t personal.
They hate everyone equally ❤️
